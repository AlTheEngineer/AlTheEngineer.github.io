Summary
==========
The goal of this project is to build a computer model that is able to predict the make of a car from an input image. The Stanford Cars Dataset [1] was used for training. fastai is a Python library for rapid machine learning deployment [2]. The library was used to train a ResNet-50 model on the data set using transfer learning. The initial validation accuracy was 57.7%. To improve the model, we use various methods from deep learning research that introduced significant reduction in error. These methods include fine-tuning, data augmentation, differential learning rates, learning rate annealing, and test-time augmentation. The final model achieves validation accuracy of 92% and test accuracy of 91%. All computations were carried out on Google's Colaboratory environment, which provides access to a NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU.

Motivation
==========

By now, I have spent sometime learning about the theory of machine
learning. So, I wanted to find an interesting problem and apply machine
learning to try to solve it. I began to think about a personal dilemma
that I’m usually faced with when I’m with my friends. All of them know
enough about cars that they are able to spot a car passing by and have
an in-depth discussion about it. On the other hand, I have little-to-no
information about cars and am usually left out of the conversation
because of this. Hence for my first machine learning application, I want
to build a model that can look at images of cars and be able to tell the
make of the car.

Preparing the Data
==================

For this task I used the Stanford Cars Dataset. The data is a collection
of images of cars and details about their make, model, and year. For the
time being, I am not concerned about the model or year of the cars. I
only want to build a model that predicts the make of the car based on
the image (BMW, Audi...etc.). I downloaded the training set from here
and the labels here. I then edited the labels of the images to only
contain the make of the car, but exclude the model and year. Here is an
example of an image from the training set and its label:

   ![Bentley](/carnet_images/Ferrari_36.png)

The training set consists of 8,144 images that belong to 49 different
classes (car makes). I used 20 percent of the training set images to use
as a validation set. The validation set should tell us how well the
model is performing on previously unseen images. I resized all images to
224x224. The images have to be square to be able to use graphical
processing units (GPUs) for accelerated computations. I chose the image
size as balance between being large enough for the model to learn
properly but small enough to reduce computational cost.

Preparing the Model
===================

The problem at hand is a multi-class image recognition problem. To solve
it, we need a model that is suitable for computer vision. In recent
years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been demonstrated to be
the best models for computer vision. Experiments also showed that deeper
(more hidden layers) models tend to achieve greater accuracy on
complicated tasks in computer vision. However, increasing the depths of
CNNs often leads to difficulties in model training. More recently, a
variant of CNNs, known as Residual Networks (ResNets), were proposed to
avoid the depth-related problems of normal CNNs. ResNets have since
achieved state-of-the-art results in major image recognition tasks. For
these reasons, I decided to use ResNet-50, a 50-layer ResNet model that
can be used for image recognition.

Transfer Learning
=================

A common first step for training a deep learning model is to initialize
the values of its parameters - the weights and biases. Our task
represents a relatively complicated problem: the model has to be able to
tell apart the different brands of cars, even though they all look
rather similar to each other. In addition, our training set has a
limited size of 8,144 images, which would make it difficult to train a
model from scratch. For these reasons, we will use a pre-trained
ResNet-50 model. This means that the model’s parameters will be
initialized using the paramters of a ResNet-50 model that was trained on
another image recognition task. This type of initialization is called
Transfer Learning. Our ResNet-50 model has been pre-trained on ImageNet
\- a corpus of almost 14 million images.

As a start, I added a fully connected layer to the end of ResNet-50 and
trained it on the raw data. In order to find a suitable learning rate, I used a method proposed by Leslie et al. [3]. It involves exponentially increasing the learning rate as the model trains on iterations until divergence occurs. This learning rate finding method is implemented in the fastai library. The plot generated below indicated that 0.08 would be a suitable learning rate.

I then ran training for 13 epochs and achieved an
accuracy of 57.2% on the validation set.

Model Tuning
============

Clearly, an accuracy of 57% is not very good. It is actually almost as
bad as I am at recognizing cars. It is important to note that the
parameters of the model’s hidden layers are optimized for recognizing
the most common human-generated images. They are not optimized for
solving our problem: recognizing cars. Therefore, I tried to fine-tune
the model parameters by training again but this time allowing the hidden
layer parameters to be updated during training. I first ran the learning rate method to find a suitable learning rate for fine-tuning. The plot below indicates that 0.001 would a suitable learning rate. 

![UNFREEZE_LR](/carnet_images/224_unfreeze_LossvsLR.png)

I then ran training for 18 epochs
and achieved an accuracy of 83.3% on the validation set. Not too bad!

Data Augmentation
=================

An 83% accuracy is much better, and the model became relatively good at
recognizing the make of a car from its image. But can we do better? The
data that we use for training has a limited size of 6,515 images without
the validation set. We need the validation set in order to measure the
performance of our models. However we can increase the size of our data
using augmentation. Data augmentation basically involves creating edited
versions of our images and adding them to our data. These edits include flipping,
rotations and zooming in. For each image, we generate 5 random augmented
images and add them to our data. Here is an example of a training image
and it’s augmentations:

![AUGMENTATIONS](/carnet_images/img_augsv2.png)

After data augmentation, we used the original pre-trained ResNet-50 for
transfer learning (13 epochs), followed by fine-tuning (18 epochs). The
model achieved an accuracy of 87.5%.

Differential Learning Rates
===========================

The parameters in the hidden layers of the pretrained ResNet-50 has
learned image features at various levels of abstractions. The early
layers learned high-level abstract features such as edges, while the
final layers learned low-level features that are more specific to the
image recognition task it was trained on. For these reasons, I wanted to
study the effect of applying different learning rates for the different
layers in the model. The basic logic is to use low learning rates on
early layers, since they already learned the high-level features present
in common human-generated images, but use higher rates for the final
layers to better learn the specific features of our data. I specified
three learning rates (0.001, 0.003, 0.01) for the model’s early, middle,
and final layers, respectively. I then trained the original ResNet-50
model as previously described. The model achieved an accuracy of 88.8%.

Cyclic Learning Rate Annealing
==============================

To further improve the model, I added learning rate annealing to the
training procedure. Learning rate annealing is a method that was
recently proposed to improve training deep learning models. It basically
involves reducing the learning rate throughout the iterations of an
epoc. The learning rate is then reset for the next epoch, and so on. The
annealing method applies a cosine functional form to reduce the learning
rate during the iterations.

![COSINE_LRA](/carnet_images/cosine_lra.png)

Furthermore, I added a multiplicative factor of 2 to the annealing
method. This means that the annealing covers one epoch before it is
reset, then two epochs before it is reset, and so on. Here is a plot of
the learning rate during iterations of model training as an illustration

![UNFREEZE_DA_DLRS_LRA_LR](/carnet_images/224_resnet50_unfreeze_da_dlrs_lra_mult_LRvsIters.png)

The model was trained using the original ResNet-50 model as previously
described with annealing added during fine-tuning. This model achieved
an accuracy of 89.9% on the validation set.

Test-time Augmentation
======================

Earlier in this project, we used data augmentation on the training set
to improve the model’s accuracy. Given a test image, what if we perform
the same augmentations on it before predicting? This is called test-time
augmentation. After training the model as previously described, I used
TTA to predict on the validation set. The model achieved an accuracy of
92%.

Model Inference
===============

After training our models as previously described. It is now time to
measure their true accuracy on the test set. The test set consists of
8,141 images that were never used during any step of model training. The
test set accuracy is a measure of the model’s ability to generalize what
it learned during training to real-life applications. I saved all the
models that we previously trained and computed their accuracy on the
test set.


| Model | Val Accuracy (%) | Test Accuracy (%) |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Transfer Learning | 57.2 | 57.4 |
| Fine-tuning | 83.3 | 82.5 |
| Data Augmentation | 87.5 | 85.9 |
| Differential Learning Rates | 88.8 | 88.1 |
| Learning Rate Annealing | 89.9 | 89.9 |
| Test-time Augmentation | 92 | 91.5 |

The Ultimate Test (JUST FOR FUN)
===============
After all this work, I wanted to put the final model to the test. How good is it actually at recognizing 
the make of a car from its image? Let's find out! I started looking for images on Google of cars that I like. 
Here is the first one:

![Tesla_s](/carnet_images/tesla_s.jpg)

I performed the same transformations on it as I did with the training data. I then gave it as input to the model 
and waited to hear its prediction. And...

Computer Says: ...Tesla!!!

I also repeated it with this image:

![Mercedes-CLA](/carnet_images/mercedes_cla.jpg)

And Computer Says: ...Mercedes-Benz!!!

I find it interesting that both images had cars with model and year that was not in the training data. But despite of this the model was able to correctly predict the make of the cars!

How cool is this?! That's deep learning for you.
