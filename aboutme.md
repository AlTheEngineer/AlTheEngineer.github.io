My name is Alaa, but [you can call me Al](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uq-gYOrU8bA "Bad Joke"). I am passionate about Biochemistry. I have a background in biochemical engineering (BEng) from University College London and scientific computing (MPhil) from the University of Cambridge. I am generally interested in too many things, but more importantly, I'm very interested in the use of concepts from various different fields to solve real problems. With that in mind, my current focus is on data science.

### my history

Work in progress.
