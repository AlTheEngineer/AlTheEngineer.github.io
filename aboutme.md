My name is Al. I am passionate about Biochemistry. I have a background in biochemical engineering (BEng) from University College London and scientific computing (MPhil) from the University of Cambridge. I am generally interested in too many things, but more importantly, I'm very interested in the use of concepts from different subject areas to solve real problems. With that in mind, my current focus is in drug discovery, bioprocess engineering, and data science.  

### my history

Work in progress.
